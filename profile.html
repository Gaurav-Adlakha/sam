            <h3>MPHASIS - Data Scientist</h3>
            <p>Mar. 2019 - Sep. 2020</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Worked in an agile team in cognitive solution and emerging technology department to design application architecture with great performance, scalability, availability, and efficiency, evaluating risk, cost and capability throughout the system and its components.</li>
                <li>Shipment Code Classification (more than 1000 categories)-Worked on multiclass classification projects for FedEx where the responsibilities included.</li>
                <li>Developing and implementing machine learning algorithms for large scale applications.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with the client for an end to end design.</li>
                <li>Utilized python to implement unsupervised machine learning document clustering technique for 1TB of unstructured data.</li>
                <li>Customer Invoice Information Extraction (Image regression. Image Segmentation, Information Retrieval)-Designed and deployed a deep learning model for information extraction from customer invoices based on understanding 2D document, which reduced the total process time by 20%.</li>
                <li>Cage Prediction-Designed and deployed the machine learning model for cage prediction of shipment based on a entity embeddings of categorical variables to allow 50+ end client to prepare the shipment effectively.</li>
                <li>Evaluated and selected most efficient and cost-effective services and storage solution for the project. Defined web app features including data validation and user permission etc. Application was delivered in three months and exceeded management expectation.</li>
                <li>Created infrastructure project to create and manage projects on AWS with Lambda using serverless architecture. Creation was simplified to One-Click and the cost for the production environment was lowered from $12000/month to $1300/month an 89% cost reduction.</li>
